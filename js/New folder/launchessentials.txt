    <h1>Included with Every Package</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">$2,000+ in Launch Essentials plus evidence-based Brand Growth tools — everything you need to launch strong and grow with confidence.</p>

    <!-- Launch Essentials Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🔑 Launch Essentials</h2>
      <p>With every Lace & Lime website, you don’t just get a site, you get <strong>true ownership</strong>. Unlike platforms that lock you in, your code and your data remain yours from day one.</p>
      <p><strong>That means:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Full access to your source code</li>
        <li>✅ Exportable content and data portability</li>
        <li>✅ No platform fees for ownership</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Before:</strong> endless back-and-forth emails, a site that breaks on mobile, no clue if people even see it.</p>
      <p><strong>After:</strong> a polished online home that saves you time, builds trust, and helps clients find you while you focus on the work you love.</p>

      <p><strong>What’s included ($2,000+ value built in):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📬 <strong>Branded & styled newsletter capture</strong> → Visitors trust your site and join your list because it looks professional from day one.</li>
        <li>🤖 <strong>Starter automations</strong> → Forms send the right links or confirmations instantly, so you save hours of 1:1 follow-up.</li>
        <li>🔒 <strong>Security & privacy protections</strong> → SSL encryption and secure forms create immediate confidence in your business.</li>
        <li>📱 <strong>Cross-device & cross-browser testing</strong> → Works everywhere — iPhone, Android, Safari, Chrome — because first impressions matter.</li>
        <li>📊 <strong>Analytics setup</strong> → Simple dashboards show you what’s working, no overwhelm.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>SEO Everywhere</strong> → Optimized for Google and beyond: social previews, directories, and apps, so your brand gets seen even when people aren’t searching.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="quote">“The automations alone saved me hours every week.”</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Brand Growth Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌿 Brand Growth Guidance</h2>
      <p>Your launch is just the start. We build on your brand using the <strong>Energy Aligned, Action Defined™</strong> framework — an <strong>evidence-based process</strong> designed to give you measurable progress, not just a finished product.</p>

      <p><strong>Before:</strong> guessing what to fix, wasting energy on systems that don’t support you.</p>
      <p><strong>After:</strong> clear voice, consistent visuals, and systems that free up your time so you can grow with confidence.</p>

      <p><strong>How we track your progress:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📋 <strong>Pre & Post Brand Assessment</strong> → A short baseline check at onboarding and a follow-up at 3 months, so you see your growth in clarity, systems, visibility, and alignment.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Progress Monitoring Checklist</strong> → Celebrate milestones like story drafted, SEO check, and newsletter live. Paired with guided prompts like <em>“Where are you saving time now?”</em></li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Quarterly Energy Aligned, Action Defined™ Tracker</strong> → Evidence-informed prompts that help you align your brand voice and values with concrete actions in outreach and systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="quote">“Seeing my pre and post assessment side by side was eye-opening.”</p>
