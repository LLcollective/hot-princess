    <h1>Included with Every Package</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Every website includes $2,000+ in Launch Essentials along with evidence-based Brand Growth tools. You’ll have what you need to launch strong and grow with confidence.</p>

    <!-- Launch Essentials Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🔑 Launch Essentials</h2>
      <p>With every Lace & Lime website, you don’t just get a site, you get <strong>true ownership</strong>. Unlike platforms that lock you in, your code and your data remain yours from day one.</p>
      <p><strong>That means:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Full access to your source code</li>
        <li>✅ Exportable content and data portability</li>
        <li>✅ No platform fees for ownership</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Before:</strong> endless follow-up emails, a site that breaks on mobile, no clear sense of whether people even find you.</p>
      <p><strong>After:</strong> a polished online home that saves time, builds trust, and helps clients discover you while you focus on your work.</p>

      <p><strong>What’s included ($2,000+ value built in):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📬 <strong>Branded and styled newsletter capture</strong> → Visitors see a professional signup form that matches your brand and builds trust from the start.</li>
        <li>🤖 <strong>Starter automations</strong> → Forms send the right links or confirmations automatically so you save hours of manual follow-up.</li>
        <li>🔒 <strong>Security and privacy protections</strong> → SSL encryption and secure forms give your clients immediate confidence.</li>
        <li>📱 <strong>Cross-device and browser testing</strong> → Your site works on iPhone, Android, Chrome, Safari, and more. First impressions are consistent and reliable.</li>
        <li>📊 <strong>Analytics setup</strong> → Simple dashboards show you who’s visiting and what’s working without overwhelming detail.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>SEO Everywhere</strong> → Your site is coded for fast load times and discoverability on Google, in directories, on apps, and in social previews. Your brand is visible even when people aren’t actively searching.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="quote">“The automations alone saved me hours every week.”</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Brand Growth Section -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>🌿 Brand Growth Guidance</h2>
      <p>Your launch is only the beginning. We build on your brand using the <strong>Energy Aligned, Action Defined™</strong> framework. This is an <strong>evidence-based process</strong> that gives you measurable progress, not just a finished product.</p>

      <p><strong>Before:</strong> guessing what to improve, wasting energy on systems that don’t support you.</p>
      <p><strong>After:</strong> clear voice, consistent visuals, and systems that save time so you can grow with confidence.</p>

      <p><strong>How we track your progress:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>📋 <strong>Pre and Post Brand Assessment</strong> → A short baseline check when you start and a follow-up at 3 months so you can see your growth in clarity, systems, visibility, and alignment.</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Progress Monitoring Checklist</strong> → Track milestones like brand story, SEO check, and newsletter launch. Paired with reflection prompts like <em>“Where are you saving time now?”</em></li>
        <li>🔄 <strong>Quarterly Energy Aligned, Action Defined™ Tracker</strong> → Evidence-informed prompts that help you align your brand voice and values with concrete action in outreach and systems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="quote">“Seeing my pre and post assessment side by side was eye-opening.”</p>
